# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Within a Kickstarter campign for a playwrite, there are many factors that can prevent it from being a success--such as loction, where it should be premired, etc. As for Fever, it is believed that it would be successful in theaters because they are both popular in the US (showed in the images below), but if the location changes to a place like Great Britian then a play should be done instead. One of the best times to start the campaign is in the summer time--specifically around May--and it should stop in the winter. In Edinburgh Research, some successful plays have been picked to be used as an example when figuring out a reasonable goal.
