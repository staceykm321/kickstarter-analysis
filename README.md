# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns For Fever

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to show comparisons between different kickstarter campaigns, their launch datas, and their funding goals to see how successful or unsuccessful they were.

# Analysis and Challenges
The first course of actin was to seperate the years from the Date Creates Conversion worksheet; this will be paired with the thearters (parent category column) to help filter the pivot chart. The cause will be the number of specified times when the theaters were successful, a failure, and canceld; with this information, a line chart was created to visualize the relationship of outcomes and the launch month. The next chart that was made was based on the percentage of how successful, a failure, or whether a play was canceled. To find this, the goal was compared between a range of goals--for example, 1000 to 4999--and the subcategory of plays. One of the challeneges that occured was finding the number of canceled plays in Outcomes Based On Goals Chart because all of the cells were 0s, which caused confusion, but, after evaluating and double checking, it was decided that there were no errors. 

# Results
Based on the information provided in the Theater Outcomes Based On Launch Data chart, theater are successful in May to July and numbers decreases around the winter time. Even with this said, April through October show the most failed productions, except for September. As for plays, it has been concluded that goals are reached when they are in the range os 4999 or less or 35000 to 44999 as expressed in the Outcomes Based On Goals Chart. Since no location was specified, all countries and currencies were used for this data; this causes limit of specific data because some places are more populated than others, the interest of plays versus theaters vary, and money does not have all the same value--for instance, a pound in Great Britian is a different value than a dollar in the United States. A suggested chart that could help would be a bar or line chart because comparing the lengths of each is easier than comparing at intersecting lines.
